# Data-Modeling-With-Cassandra


In this project, I have worked on a directory of CSV files partitioned by date.

STEP 1: Intially, Designed the tables as per the queries outlined
STEP 2: Created the Keyspace and set that Keyspace 
STEP 3: later, created the tables as per the quesries required with the PrimaryKey
STEP 4: Loaded the data with Insert data in each of the table
Step 5 : Created the drop table command inorder to drop the table if they exist


The dataset contains columns like
- artist 
- firstName of user
- gender of user
- item number in session
- last name of user
- length of the song
- level (paid or free song)
- location of the user
- sessionId
- song title
- userId
-
